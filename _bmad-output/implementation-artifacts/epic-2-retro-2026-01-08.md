## 🛑 Challenges & Struggles

### 1. The "Missing Link" (Story 2.6)

**Issue:** The dashboard "Manage" button linked to a non-existent route (`/dashboard/game/[id]`) instead of the config page.
**Impact:** Broken user journey for hosts trying to edit games.
**Root Cause:** Story 2.6 didn't explicitly define the target route, and developers guessed wrong.
**Fix:** Remedial Task 2 updated the link to `/dashboard/game/[id]/config`.

### 2. Layout Inconsistency (Story 1.3/2.6)

**Issue:** The "Header" was hardcoded in `dashboard/page.tsx` instead of a layout file, causing it to disappear on sub-pages.
**Impact:** Poor UX; no navigation/logout on Config or Create pages.
**Root Cause:** Technical debt from Epic 1; skipped creating a proper `layout.tsx`.
**Fix:** Remedial Task 1 created `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`.

### 3. Missing Landing Page

**Issue:** The root URL (`/`) showed the Next.js starter template.
**Impact:** No public entry point for the app.
**Fix:** Remedial Task 3 implemented a Hero section.

## 🏆 Successes & Wins

### 1. Database Schema Design (Story 2.1)

**Win:** The `Game`, `GamePattern`, and `Pattern` schema proved robust for configuration.
**Why:** Verification of requirements during schema design paid off.

### 2. Remedial Action Speed

**Win:** The team identified critical UX blockers during the Retro and fixed them immediately (Remedy Epic 2).
**Why:** "Stop the Line" mentality—fixing quality issues before moving to complexities of Epic 3.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1.  **Define navigational flows explicitly:** Stories should specify exactly where buttons link to (e.g., "Links to `/config`", not just "Links to game").
2.  **App Shell First:** Always ensure the Layout structure (`layout.tsx`) is in place before building individual pages to ensure consistency.
